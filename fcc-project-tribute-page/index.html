            <h3>Here's a time line of Manu Ginobili's career:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>1977</b> Born in Bahia Blanca, Argentina.
                </li>

                    <b>1999</b> San Antonio Spurs selected him in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Round / 57<sup>th</sup> Pick as Shooting Guard.
                    The reason why Manu is (and will be) the biggest robbery in NBA history is because no one imagined that such a good player would be selected in such a distant instance.

                    <b>2002</b> Joins the Spurs and soon became a key player for the team.

                <li>
